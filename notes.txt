Anyone can build an application that works
Not everyone can build an application that is "maintainable" (easy to change)

Maintaining
    Bug Fixes
    Adding New Features (Extensibility)
    Removing Dead Features

class PastClass{

}

Class PresentClass{
    private PastClass _pastClass;
    public PresentClass(){
        _pastClass = new PastClass();
    }
    public void DoSomething(){
        _pastClass.DoSomething();
    }
}


class FutureClass{

}

No tight coupling

OO Design Principles
    Open Closed Principle
    Dependency Inversion Principle
    Single Responsibility Principle

Write a simple console program that will do the following
    1. Accept the userName from the user
    2. Print a personalized greeting message
        if hour of the day < 12
            "Hi Magesh, Good Morning!"
        else
            "Hi Magesh, Good Afternoon!"

Code Smells
    1. new
    2. static classes & static methods
    3. if then & switch case

Instead of small number of large classes, better to have large number of small classes


Commanility Variability
    Keep what is common together
    Move out what is varying

Homework:
    Create a Filter method in the Products using which the user should be able to filter the products by any criteria. For ex:
        filter costly products (cost > 1000)
        filter stationary products (category = "Stationary")
        filter affordable products (!costly products)
        filter costly stationary products
        etc

            Accelerate()

Creational Patterns

Structural Patterns
    Relations between the objects and classes

    Adapter
        To convert the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.
        Adapter lets classes work togehter that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

    Bridge
        To separate the interface of a class from its implementation.
        Bridge lets the two parts of a class vary independently.

public class CityFromExternalSystem{

}

public class City {
    public City(CityFromExternalSystem cityFromExternalSystem){
        //converting the external system city to our city
    }
}

public class Employee{
    public int Id;
    public string Name;
    public string City;

    public Employee(int id){
        Id = id;
    }

}

var emp = new Employee(100) { Name = "", City ="" }

emp.Id = 100
emp.Name = "magesh"
emp.City = "Bengaluru"
